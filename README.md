# Crypto Cracker

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The program is currently unfinished! You can encrypt and partially decrypt using Vigenere, and both encrypt and decrypt using rot. This does require you to change the values in the files presently.

The Vigenere decryption is written and works logically, however mapping the correct values to the key is a bit hit and miss, as usually it's a couple of letters that are very close to matching the letter frequency of the English language. Not sure how to fix this presently.

### To-Do

- [ ] Finish Vigenere deciphering program
- [ ] Add string input in program
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Remove duplciation of text printing (getch handling)
- [ ] Norm Compliance
